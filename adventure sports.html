		<h2> Diving </h2>
        <p>Surrounded by the Indian Ocean with its coral gardens, multitude of exotic fishes and ancient wrecks Sri Lanka offers one of the best diving experiences in the world. The colorful coral gardens along southern coasts and old and new ship wrecks around the Galle harbor and little and great basses are the favourite Sri Lankan dive sites yet Kalpitiya, Ampara and Trincomalee in Eastern and Western coasts offering rare chances of wreck diving, skin diving and diving with dolphins.</p>
		<p> The ocean around Sri Lanka whispers of tales bygone, ones of regal maritime visits, of bandits and pirates and journeys of explorers and spice merchants.  As you plunge into the warm waters and dive below, these stories come to life. The crystal clear waters of the Indian Ocean with a visibility of 20 meters (65ft) provide perfect conditions for diving.  With wrecks as dated as the 18th Century dotting the seas, deep reefs and reef walls provide enthralling explorations for scuba divers. For the less adventurous on-shore coral reefs are ideal for snorkelling. The abundant marine life found around the island is surpassed only at Hikkaduwa in the southern coast where the reef is thought to contain more species of fish than the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
		<h2> Surfing </h2>
        <p>Surf’s up in Sri Lanka! The east coast’s Arugam Bay is the best –kept secret among serious surfers, through gaining popularity worldwide not only for its waves but also for the pristine and beautiful beaches that surround it. Sri Lanka is a surfer’s paradise anytime of the year. Once the season ends at Arugam Bay, at another surfing hotspot especially for recreational surfers the season begins, along the southern coast in Hikkaduwa, Wewala and Narigama.</p>
