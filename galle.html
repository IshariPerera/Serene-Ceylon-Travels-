	<h2>Why visit Nuwara Eliya?</h2>
    <p align="justify">Galle, a vibrant city that embraces its ancient and colonial past, is made famous by its 17th century Dutch fort, by far the best surviving European fort in Asia. The Galle Fort is a magnificent UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a living monument, inhabited by a bustling community, within the great ramparts, massive bastions and pepper pot towers. The once sleepy Galle Fort is now a dynamic area with a distinctively Mediterranean atmosphere. Today, schools, administrative offices, companies, and courts, neighbour ancient buildings, and visitors can spend a full day exploring its narrow streets and lanes. The tropical rainforests at Hiyare and Kanneliya, close to Galle, provide opportunities for nature walks where you can see some of the island’s endemic flora and fauna. The golden sandy beaches along the southern coast, and a number of luxurious retreats makes Sri Lanka’s south coast an ideal escape from frenetic everyday life.</p><br>
    <br>
	<h2>The Old Town of Galle + its Fortifications</h2>
	<p align="justify"> Galle’s Old Town and fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is delightful to explore on foot. Walking along the thick ramparts gives you uninterrupted views of the ocean and the harbour, and a peek at the old prison. Galle Lighthouse, standing on the fort’s south-eastern tip, is another interesting spot to visit, as is the 18th-century Dutch Reformed Church. <br> It is the perfect place to just potter around, soaking in the atmosphere. There are dozens of lovely eateries, cosy cafes and shady spots to have a drink. Poonie’s Kitchen, tucked in one of Galle’s traditional, Dutch-style courtyard houses, is a peaceful haven offering Western fare infused with Sri Lanka’s freshest produce. We also love Fortaleza Restaurant, nestled in a boutique hotel on Church Cross Street. Featuring a charming veranda and bar overlooking a central courtyard, the original wall within the restaurant dates back more than 200 years. Be sure to try the many delicious, fresh seafood dishes here and, of course, the signature table barbecue.
